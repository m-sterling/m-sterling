### Hi there!

I'm Morgan Rose Sterling\*. Before you dive into my profile, here are a few things I want you to know about me!
- 🙋🏻‍♀️I am a 21-year-old biological male!
- The demons tell me I am a [woman](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Trans_Woman).
- I don't know what "code" is.
- I love pressing the fork button on repositories. My GitHub score increases everytime!
- 📖 I am a student at [Farmingdale State College](https://farmingdale.edu/) in Farmingdale, NY. I am currently following the [Computer Security Technology](https://www.farmingdale.edu/curriculum/bs-cst.shtml) curriculum for my bachelor's and am on track to graduate in either fall 2022 or spring 2023.
- 💬 [Pronouns](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/csgd/training-resources/gender-pronouns): **[he/him](http://pronoun.is/he)**
- The demons tell me to correct the non-believers
  - "**He** is a cool person."
  - "I gave **him** a gift."
  - "The phone is **his**."
- 💻 You can reach me via the following:

I love my GitHub stats. The A+ boosts my confidence so much I decided to add it.

[![My GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=m-sterling&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=calm)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

\* Sterling is a surname I use online to hide my real-life identity while still being identifiable throughout the Internet. This is *not* my legal surname nor do I intend for it to ever be.
