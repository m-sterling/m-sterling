<sup><sup>1</sup></sup> Sterling is a surname I use online to hide my real-life identity while still being identifiable throughout the Internet. This is *not* my legal surname, nor do I intend for it to ever be.

<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> When using fae/faer pronouns to refer to me, the subject pronoun (eg. "**Fae** are a cool person.") can be used in both a singular and plural grammatical sense; that is, in the same way you would say "she **is**" and "they **are**," you can say either "fae **is**" or "fae **are**" (just be sure to keep it consistent; don't mix-and-match them like "Fae **is** nice. Fae **are** also smart.").
