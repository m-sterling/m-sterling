### Hi there!

I'm Morgan Rose Sterling<sup><sup>1</sup></sup> – here are a few things about me!
- 🙋🏻‍♀️I am a 22-year-old [transgender woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman)!

- 💬 [My pronouns](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/csgd/training-resources/gender-pronouns) are, in order of preference, **[fae/faer/faers](http://pronoun.is/fae)**, **[she/her/hers](http://pronoun.is/she)**, and **[they/them/theirs](http://pronoun.is/she)**.
  - "**Fae**<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> are a cool person." *or* "**She** is a cool person." *or* "**They** are a cool person."

<sup><sup>1</sup></sup> Sterling is a surname I use online to hide my real-life identity while still being identifiable throughout the Internet. This is *not* my legal surname, nor do I intend for it to ever be.

<sup><sup>2</sup></sup> When using fae/faer pronouns to refer to me, the subject pronoun ("**Fae** are a cool person.") can be used in both a singular and plural grammatical sense; that is, in the same way you would say "she **is**" and "they **are**," you can say either "fae **is**" or "fae **are**" (just be sure to keep it consistent; don't mix-and-match them like "Fae **is** nice. Fae **are** also smart.").
